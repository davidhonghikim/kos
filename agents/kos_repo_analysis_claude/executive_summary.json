    "situation": "ChatGPT provided a comprehensive analysis of 6 kOS repositories but proposed an architecturally flawed implementation that would not work in practice.",
    "problem": "ChatGPT's KLF implementation is incompatible with existing systems, lacks security, ignores innovative architecture, and would create technical debt.",
    "solution": "Build on proven Griot KLF foundation, integrate AI-Q's innovative kitchen/pantry system, implement security-first design, and follow comprehensive testing strategy.",
